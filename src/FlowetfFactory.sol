/**
 * @title FlowetfFactory
 * @notice Deploys one vault per token and binds it to a long.xyz pool only
 *         after verifying, on-chain, that the vault really is that pool's fee
 *         beneficiary.
 *
 * WHY A FACTORY AT ALL
 *   long.xyz records fee beneficiaries at launch and they are effectively
 *   permanent afterwards. So the vault must EXIST BEFORE the token does — its
 *   address goes into the launch parameters. That ordering drives everything
 *   below.
 *
 * THE FLOW
 *   1. deployVault(salt, creator)  — vault exists, address is known
 *   2. the dev launches on long.xyz with that vault as the 95% beneficiary
 *   3. register(token, vault)      — this contract READS the pool's beneficiary
 *                                    list and refuses unless the vault is
 *                                    genuinely on it
 *
 *   Step 3 is a check, not a promise. Nobody has to be trusted for the
 *   registry to be accurate: a token whose fees do not actually flow to its
 *   vault cannot be registered at all.
 *
 * ADDRESS ORDERING — the non-obvious constraint
 *   Doppler requires the beneficiary array to be sorted ascending by address
 *   (`UnorderedBeneficiaries`). The protocol's own beneficiary sits at
 *   0x21e2ce70..., so a vault that sorts BELOW it can never be launched with —
 *   and the failure surfaces as an opaque revert during launch, long after the
 *   dev has committed. deployVault therefore refuses such a salt up front,
 *   where the error is cheap and legible.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CONTRACT DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO
 *   It never forwards arbitrary calldata. The only external calls it makes are
 *   to a hard-coded pool initializer with a hard-coded selector. A factory that
 *   could be asked to call anything would be a way to reach
 *   updateBeneficiary() and move a vault's fee stream — the single thing the
 *   whole design exists to prevent.
